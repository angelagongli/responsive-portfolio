# Responsive Portfolio

## Description
The responsive portfolio builds on the first homework by adding a responsive layout to the portfolio website, enabling it to display properly on different devices with various screen dimensions. It features Bootstrap's grid system and components, media queries, and responsive images.

This website is a portfolio showcasing a number of project chosen from my work. It also provides some basic background information about me, and enables online visitors to leave a message via contact form.

The website consists of three separate pages:
* [About Me](https://angelagongli.github.io/responsive-portfolio/index.html): a brief introduction to who I am
* [Portfolio](https://angelagongli.github.io/responsive-portfolio/portfolio.html): displays a collection of projects selected from my work
* [Contact](https://angelagongli.github.io/responsive-portfolio/contact.html): a contact form for online users to type and submit a message

## Credits
The background image used on each page of this website was taken from the free library of patterns at [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/).

The favicon and contact link icon images were taken from the collection of icons at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

The images used in the various project cards shown on the Portfolio page were sourced from the following websites:
* https://buffalobayou.org/
* https://www.presentationmagazine.com/
* https://www.lifehacker.com.au/
* https://unsplash.com/ (photos by [Cassiano Psomas](https://unsplash.com/@psomas?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) and [Tom Thain](https://unsplash.com/@tthfilms?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText))

Explanations of methods to create the responsive images that appear on the About Me and Portfolio pages were found in the [Responsive Images tutorial](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-images/) by Oliver James of [InternetingIsHard.com](https://internetingishard.com/).

The design and styling of the pages was inspired by, and indeed, required by, the Coding Boot Camp at UT. This iteration of the portfolio website relies heavily on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create the responsive layout.
